# Welcome to the Water Test Network
Due to the recent discoveries of high levels of iron in the water in Flint Michigan, I am forming a group of concerned citizens who want to take on the responsibility of testing our all waters sources like city water, wells, streams, rivers, and lakes and posting the results to our website.  We will then store and analyze the water test results and display them in on our website.

## WE CANNOT DEPEND ON THE GOVERNMENT TO KEEP OUR WATER SAFE!
