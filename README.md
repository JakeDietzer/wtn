# Welcome to the Water Test Network
Due to the recent discoveries of high levels of iron in the water in Flint Michigan, I am forming a group of concerned citizens who want to take on the responsibility of testing our all waters sources like city water, wells, streams, rivers, and lakes and posting the results to our website.  The water test results will be displayed on our website for everyone to see.

### WE CANT DEPEND ON GOVERNMENTS, CORPORATIONS, OR FARMS FOR KEEPING OUR WATERS CLEAN
